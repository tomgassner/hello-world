intro code 
/* Hi! My name is Tom, I am a senior in Univeristy studying Exericse Physiology and Sports Administration. I have always had an interest in computers but never mustered up the courage to take a course or teach myself. I had an opening in my final semester senior year of college, so I am taking a java course. I hope GitHub will give me insight into the real world of programming to see how to apply my skills.
